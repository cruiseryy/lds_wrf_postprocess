# lds_wrf_postprocess

Please refer to the new utilities.py

Main Features:

1. read rainfall data
2. compute the rescaling weights for each sub-interval i as weight_{i,j} and their averages R_{i}
3. extract the continous trajs using the saved topo (how do i recover the topo?)
4. compute the estimated CDF (return periods)
5. plot the trajs
6. plot the maps
7.
